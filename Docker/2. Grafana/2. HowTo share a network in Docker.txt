Find the required IP addres for bridging the Influx and Grafana network:

Use the docker desktop, open the Influxdb container page, click inspect, click the network tab and find the "IPAddress": line
Copy the IP address (in my case: "172.17.0.2")

This is the IP address you will need to add the "InfluxDB server" as a Grafana datasource
